DESCRIPTION

A simple library of files which can be downloaded directly from github, which
serve as alternatives to more sophisticated libraries which are troublesome to
install.

The currently available libraries are as follows:

    Crude_Z_Test.py
        Offers an alternative to scipy.stats.norm.sf()



REQUIREMENTS

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.

Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.

Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS

You don't need to know how to use git to use this program. You can simply open
the file you want in your online browser and copy it's contents onto a local 
file on your computer with the same name.

If you need this library to run another program, either paste a copy of that
file into the same folder as the ".py" file of that program, or configure your 
Python runtime environment so that it is possible for said program to access 
the file in question.
